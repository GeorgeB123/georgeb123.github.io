<p>My name is George Bonnici-Carter. I am a tech enthusiast currently living and working in the UK. Currently working as a backend drupal developer, I enjoy learning new technologies and software whenever I can. I also enjoy the outdoors and adventure wherever I can find it.</p>

<p>After graduating from the University of Otago, New Zealand, I decided to embark on an adventure to the otherside of the world earlier this year. It has been one of the most challenging and exciting years of my life so far.</p>

<p>This blog is my experiences adapting to life in the world and my time travelling and seeing the sights. Feel free to browse my work(however little is shown) on github and get in touch if you'd like to!</p>
