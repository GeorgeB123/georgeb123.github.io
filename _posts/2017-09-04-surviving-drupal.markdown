<h2 class="section-heading">Surviving</h2>

<p>It has been a whirlwind year so far. After landing in London late February, I was virtually homeless for the first three weeks until I was fortunate enough to find my first software development job. The job seemed to be the easy part as a bank account and accomdation were much harder to come across</p>

<p>I've learnt the UK is extremely bureacratic and this often means things taking a lot longer than expected. I needed a house to get a bank account and a bank account to get a house - talk about catch 22. Luckily, my work stepped in and was my address for a while so that all got sorted eventually.</p>

<p>After settling in, I have found surviving to be not too difficult. I am constantly occupied by the daily routine and never seem to have enough time (I think that means I'm getting older) but am happy where I have landed, which is in leafy Hertfordshire. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Drupal</h2>

<p>For those wondering - what is Drupal? Well here's a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/about" target="_blank">link</a> if you want to get right in to it. But for those less interested, it is a very powerful and flexible content management system that I work with to create websites.</p>

<p>It was all very bewildering for me. Coming in to Drupal, which I'd never heard of, and working with PHP, which I'd never used. In hindsight, it was good that I learned like I did because I also learnt a lot about SQL and how to teach myself. Also, the learning curve was very steep (as I am still finding out) and I did not have a clue what I was doing for the first three months.</p>

<p>After this initial shock period, I have slowly become accustomed to life as a Drupal developer. A lot of it is finding the right module and applying it, but it's all new to me so it's interesting never the less. I never thought I would work in this field but I am enjoying it so far.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Rest</h2>

<p>There's not a whole lot else to say at this point. I am happy in my job but always looking for new things to learn and take on. I have started reading at a rate of about 2 books a month which has been a good night cap and try and keep fit and reasonably healthy.</p>

<p>I am looking in to mobile development in the future as I would like to expand my swift skills and have a few projects going already. These can be seen on my github which is linked below.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot else really, I am looking forward to going home over the new years period and travelling some more next year. I might pick up a new hobby or something, who knows? Anyway, that's all for know, get in touch if you have any questions or just would lke to say hi.</p>
