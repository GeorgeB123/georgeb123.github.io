<h2 class="section-heading">The Cold rolls on</h2>

<p>It has been a while since I have written but I have been busy! The cold still drags on toward the end of January and I am looking forward to the sun more than I thought. Before my holiday back home, the year wrapped up pretty quickly as December rolled through as I was frantically organizating Christmas presents and myself for my break. A christmas party at the beginning of December was well received (maybe too well as I was sick for about a week after) as a mild blanket for the cold and then just the winding down of work.</p>

<p>My house has only just become heated to a degree of comfortability and I feel as though I have been fighting off colds for the majority of winter but this is ok as my flatmates are a pleasure to live with. I even got a present from two of them! It was an enormous rain poncho that could mistake me as some kind of blue slenderman if caught wearing it, but nevertheless, a very nice gesture.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Home for the Holidays</h2>

<p>The main reason *cough* I have not written in about two months is because of my 3 week break over Christmas and New Years. This break was capped off with a lovely few days in Norway then off home to New Zealand for just over 2 weeks. The flights were very long as I have not flown anywhere near that distance since the beginning of last year and I remembered very quickly what it was like. Mind you, the worst part was when I got to New Zealand and forgot a mandarin in my carry on! Oops, there goes $400...</p>

<p>After this little mishap, the rest of the holiday was smooth sailing. After recovering from jet lag, the combination of sun and parental pampering was just what the doctor orderd. We did most of Northland going right up to Cape Reinga and even accross to the bay of islands. There was a slight storm mid break but this just gave me more of an excuse to relax, which I obliged, of course. Aside from that, the beach was frequently visited for 2 minute swims and copious amounts of sunscreen was applied.</p>

<p>One thing I forgot about when going home was catching up with friends. I hadn't planned to see many but was pleasantly surprised to see a whole bunch of them over my time, just making me realize that the friends I have are good friends. My family was the same as I didn't realise how much I missed them until I was home again. This just all makes me appreciate how lucky I am to be where I am and have the support I do.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">To the tech part</h2>

<p>Now if we want to talk about the fun stuff in my life, it all goes here. Before Christmas, I managed to get my Drupal 7 site builder certification. That means basically that if you need a basic site built in Drupal, I'm the guy. I was very happy with my (close) pass as I have not had as much experience as I would have liked before taking the test. I feel as though I am much more confident navigating and dealing with Drupal now. Drupal 8 and developer tests next! </p>

<p>When it comes to my side projects, the new ARKit for ios has been extremely exciting. I played around with it a bit and managed to make a somewhat simple AR app. You can see this <a href = "https://github.com/GeorgeB123/RealWorldAR">here</a>. There was a lot of vector calculus invloved and I had to look back at first and second year uni to solve a few of the challenges! So much for maths being useles huh? I am more interested in this now and would like to try build more complicated AR apps. Guess it's time for a phone upgrade!</p>

<p>Now as we head in to February and are already <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> of the year down, I am looking in to getting more involved with some core languages. I think getting back in to Java or C might be the way to go. But who knows, maybe I won't also.</p>

<p>Well, I think that's about it for another month. I hope you enjoyed my little update and don't be afraid to pop us any questions! Until next time.</p>
