<h2 class="section-heading">The Grind</h2>

<p>I have now officially been a full time working man for 7 months, so you would think that the work would get easier. I have been mistaken. After my initial ease in period, I have found myself even more lost at times as drupal once again shows it's steep learning curve.</p>

<p>I have finished my second data migration on drupal and it seemed to be even harder than the first. From image paths to content types, nothing seemed to work the first time. This, in turn with balancing single sign on, led to many headaches. I have to look at the positives however, as I feel the next migration should be smoother (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>Apart from the actual content of work, I am finding the weeks far too long compared to the weekends. This 5 days on 2 days off thing is not for me. I think 4 days on 3 days off would be perfect, but anyone can dream can't they? No I shouldn't complain, my job is great and the people I work with are too.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">IOS</h2>

<p>Outside of work work, I am focussing on IOS development as more of a passion. I have put together a few small apps in the past months and am trying to muster something up to put on the app store. Mainly in Xcode and swift, I have been trying to learn the ways of clean efficient code and can see improvements after every app.</p>

<p>This has also lead me to investigate new mobile app technologies. I have stumbled upon a few but the main one I have found is called Ionic. <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> is a cross platform open source framework that uses html/css and js to make the magic happen. I am thinking about using this on an app soon but with swift 4 being released and having to learn js, I'm not sure how much time I'll find.</p>

<p>So if you have any ideas, let me know!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Living</h2>

<p>On the non tech side of things, I couldn't be happier where I am. Hertford proves to be a nicer place each time I visit the town and I am getting used to the English way of living. One thing I am not looking forward to however, is the winter, as walking everywhere may be a touch more uncomfortable. I guess I might actually have to start wearing trousers soon.</p>

<p>Apart from that, I am travelling lots and doing what I like really. I had my one outing in a blue moon in Hertford town, which rudely reminded me why I don't drink often. I think this last quarter of the year will fly by as Christmas is creeping up and presents are needed to be bought. This will be no problem though, as I can't wait for my trip home over new years.</p>

<p>I think that's all I have for now but I'll to keep to once a month or so. Take care y'all!</p>
