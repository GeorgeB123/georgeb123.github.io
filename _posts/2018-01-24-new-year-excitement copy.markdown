<h2 class="section-heading">I love the Weather</h2>

<p>As we speed into the year, the cold follows us like a tepid hangover. Now being early April, Winter is finally starting to tail off. This week has finally reached double figures consistently, with an average of  14! I am very happy to finally see the back of this winter as it was difficult to maintain my shorts only appearance.</p>

<p>Apart from the change of weather, the same old same old has been going on around Hertford. I am very accustomed to the cruisy lifestyle which I live and have even started to order my food online! What an amazing concept I stumbled upon during my time in the sling (will get to that later). With everything coming along nicely, I am looking forward to the heat rolling in and hopefully a bit of travel over Summer!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">One Year Anniversary</h2>

<p>I have now officially past the one year mark, both at my job and living away from New Zealand. It is crazy to think that a year has already flown by as I feel it has been no time at all! I guess time flies when you're having fun! This has made me realize how much I have done over the last year and gets me excited for all the things that could happen this year too. That includes me being very late on updates, so I'll try a bit harder... </p>

<p>I have been getting slacker and slacker over the last few posts about writing frequency but do have a good reason this time I swear! About 4 weeks ago, I decided to go indoor skiing one afternoon. All was going well  until about 15 minutes from the end of the session, I had a fantastic tumble. I am usually quite good at falling, but not this time! I fell hard on my left shoulder and managed to break my collar bone! What fun. To make a long story short, ended up in A&E for the evening and in a sling for 4-8 weeks - glory!</p>

<p>Aside from this happening over the last few months, I have not lived the exciting life that you have come to expect from me. With the exception of a few trips to Norway, I have mainly been tucking in to rest and recovery during the weekends as I have found myself run down by the lovable cold.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Fun Stuff</h2>

<p>When I say the fun stuff, I mean all the stuff that I've learnt lately - this includes tech and general life skills. We'll start with what I've been doing work wise. At work I feel like I am becoming increasingly more comfortable in Drupal and all the development tools surrounding that. I have created my own custom module and am looking to contribute - when it gets the seal of approval from a couple of the senior devs of course. </p>

<p>I also had my first yearly review and with that, much promise. I am on track and am being put up to the task on sitting my Drupal 8 developer test in the next few months. I am not sure if I am truly ready for it but want to give it the best go I can. With this test, I will have to brush up on some core concepts like <i>Frontend</i>! This scares me as I have done next to no front end work this far so might be a bit of a challenge.</p>

<p>As for side projects and other things. I am staying to PHP at the moment as I would like to become extremely proficient in this language. I have created an API, just a small test one to practice creating enpoints and get responses, but feel that it is very valuable to understand how it is built.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed that update and will try to post more! Since I am in a sling, I am currently a one arm dev so no promises - see y'all next time!</p>
