<h2 class="section-heading">Changing of the Seasons</h2>

<p>It is finally getting colder as I can no longer muster the courage to wear shorts everyday and with the cold comes the darkness. I've never really noticed how early it gets dark in winter until actually experiencing what it's like to go to work and come home in the dark. Oh the joys of a 9 to 5. It's not all bad however, as the rolling Winter months mean that Christmas is approaching and also my trip home.</p>

<p>I shouldn't be so negative of the cold and the changing of the months as I have settled in to a nice routine. Work has treated me well too as I am still employed(luckily) and we have a Christmas party next Friday which is shaping up to be a big day. I still don't completely understand the northern hemisphere's fascination of Christmas(it seems like such a big deal here) as I would rather have a quiet morning in the sun.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Work & other escapades</h2>

<p>I am now in the solid mindset of working and it seems to be coming along nicely. I still feel as though I should be much further ahead than where I am but am reasonably satisfied also. Things are starting to come to me a bit easier than they did before and am starting to learn a few new technologies like Jira. This is a welcome change after the initial grind of drupal migrations(and scary clients).</p>

<p>I am finding a bit more interest in some of the things I am working on now as I guess I am starting to understand a lot more. This is a nice change even though I still feel as though I am banging my head against the wall sometimes. I cannot appreciate the team I work with more as they are so understanding and helpful in everything.</p>

<p>In terms of other projects that I have been working on, it has been pretty quiet recently to be honest. I am still dabbling in IOS dev when I can and made a practice todo app, learning how to use realm on the way, which is actually a very nice substitute for Core Data or SQLite. If you're interested, have a <a href="https://realm.io/">look!</a> I am a little bit run down in terms of creative motive at the moment but it won't take me long to be back up and running!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Life Abroad</h2>

<p>Now to my life outside of English weather and tech. I have been finally able to travel a little bit more as in the previous two weeks, I have been to Norway and Wales. Norway is a stunning country and I am heppy every time I visit. Wales was a trip with a few of the boys from work and it was a lot of fun. We climbed one of the highest peaks in south Wales, which turned out to only be an hour and a half walk, then took on Cardiff in the evening, which turned out to be a rather large night. 8/8 would recommend both places.</p>

<p>Aside from travel, I have been just hitting the gym in these cold months and eating a lot. Finally reached my goals at the gym with one month to spare (time for some new goals!) and social football has been ticking over each week. Getting a bit sick of it but it's not too bad when we actually play. </p>

<p>Now the next thing on the cards is my trip home! I am extremely excited to go home and get some sun and see my family - I think I need a break too. So yeah, I think that's all for this time! Take care and I'll give ya another update in a month or so! (or however long it takes..)</p>
